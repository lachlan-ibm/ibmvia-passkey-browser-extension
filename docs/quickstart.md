Next, navigate to a webpage that supports WebAuthn registration and authentication ceremonies such as:

- [WebAuthn.io](https://webauthn.io/)
- [webauthn.dodo.dev](https://webauthn.dodo.dev/passwordless)
- [token2](https://www.token2.com/tools/fido2-demo)

Additionally, if you have access to w3id on IBM Security Verify, you can test the extension against a [demonstration site](https://fidointerop.securitypoc.com/) managed by Shane Weeden.
